## 1. Attacks & Exploitation

### Prompt Injection

Prompt injection is the primary attack class against LLM-integrated applications. It splits into two types: **direct injection** (user-controlled input manipulates the model) and **indirect injection** (malicious instructions arrive via data the model retrieves — web pages, documents, tool outputs, emails).

**Key attack techniques:**

| Technique | What It Does | Research / Reference |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Indirect Prompt Injection** | Attacker embeds instructions in external data (web pages, emails, documents) that a model retrieves and acts on — without the user knowing. Enables data exfiltration, unauthorized actions. | Greshake et al., 2023 — [arXiv:2302.12173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173) |
| **Second-Order Injection** | Malicious payload is stored (in a DB, email, memory) and triggers on a future retrieval — not the initial request. Survives session resets. | Common in agentic systems with persistent memory |
| **P2SQL Injection** | Prompt injection that routes through an LLM-to-SQL translator, turning natural language into malicious SQL. Different from classic SQLi. | Pedro, Castro et al., 2023 — [arXiv:2308.01990](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01990) |
| **Encoding / Obfuscation Bypasses** | Base64, Unicode homoglyphs, zero-width characters, multi-layer encoding, language switching — used to evade content filters that block plaintext injection strings. | [ARC PI Taxonomy](https://github.com/Arcanum-Sec/arc_pi_taxonomy) — evasion dimension |
| **Token Budget Exhaustion** | Floods the context window to push out system prompt instructions or safety context. | Relevant for fixed-context deployments |
| **HouYi Framework** | Three-phase injection: disrupt context → inject payload → deliver. Structured methodology for constructing injection chains. | Liu et al., 2023 — [arXiv:2306.05499](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05499) |
| **Crescendo (Multi-Turn)** | Gradually escalates a conversation from benign to harmful over 3–5 turns. Exploits the LLM's tendency to maintain topic coherence with its own prior outputs. Crescendomation automates this. | [arXiv:2404.01833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833) |
| **Many-Shot Jailbreaking** | Fills long context windows with many examples of harmful Q&A, exploiting in-context learning against aligned models. Power-law relationship between shot count and success rate. | Anthropic, 2024 — [anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com/research/many-shot-jailbreaking) |

**Real-world vulnerabilities:**

- **[CVE-2025-53773](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53773)** — GitHub Copilot RCE via prompt injection. Attacker-controlled code comments triggered Copilot to generate and execute malicious code.

[microsoft.com/security/blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/10/ai-recommendation-poisoning/)
- **Perplexity Comet injection (Trail of Bits, Feb 2026)** — Audit of Perplexity's Comet browser AI assistant found four prompt injection techniques that could exfiltrate private Gmail data. [blog.trailofbits.com](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/02/20/using-threat-modeling-and-prompt-injection-to-audit-comet/)
- **Reprompt (Varonis, Mar 2026)** — Single-link attack against Microsoft Copilot that bypasses data-leak protections and enables persistent session exfiltration even after Copilot is closed. [varonis.com/blog](https://www.varonis.com/blog/reprompt)

**Classification:**

- [ARC Prompt Injection Taxonomy](https://github.com/Arcanum-Sec/arc_pi_taxonomy) — The most structured open classification of prompt injection attacks. Four dimensions: attacker intent (13 categories), execution technique (18), filter evasion method (20), input surface. Interactive frontend: https://arcanum-sec.github.io/arc_pi_taxonomy/

- [Promptware Kill Chain (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09625) — Documents 21 real-world prompt injection incidents from 2025, classifying them via a kill-chain model. Finds persistence capabilities in 12 of 21 attacks.

### Jailbreaking LLMs

Jailbreaking bypasses the safety alignment of a model to elicit policy-violating outputs. Distinct from prompt injection (which hijacks an integrated application); jailbreaking targets the model's trained refusal behavior directly.

**Gradient-based attacks (white-box):**

- **GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient)** — Optimizes a universal adversarial suffix that reliably bypasses aligned LLMs and transfers across models including GPT-4, Claude, Bard. Foundational paper: [arXiv:2307.15043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). Production implementation: [BrokenHill](https://github.com/BishopFox/BrokenHill) (Bishop Fox).
- **AutoDAN** — Automated generation of human-readable adversarial prompts using genetic algorithms. Produces jailbreaks that are fluent and harder to detect than GCG suffixes. [github.com/SheltonLiu-N/AutoDAN](https://github.com/SheltonLiu-N/AutoDAN)
- **DiffusionAttacker** — Uses a seq2seq diffusion model to generate jailbreak prompts. Outperforms prior methods on fluency, diversity, and attack success rate. EMNLP 2025. [arXiv:2412.17522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17522)

**Black-box attacks (query-only):**

- **PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement)** — An LLM-as-attacker that iteratively refines jailbreak prompts until a target model complies. Achieves jailbreaks in ~20 queries. [arXiv:2310.08419](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08419)
- **TAP (Tree of Attacks with Pruning)** — Extends PAIR with a tree search to prune ineffective attack branches. More efficient than PAIR on complex safety categories. [github.com/RICommunity/TAP](https://github.com/RICommunity/TAP)
- **Bad Likert Judge** — Instructs the target LLM to evaluate harmfulness on a Likert scale, then requests examples aligned to the highest-rated category. Boosts success rates >60% across tested models. Palo Alto Unit 42, 2024. [unit42.paloaltonetworks.com](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/multi-turn-technique-jailbreaks-llms/)
- **Crescendo** — Multi-turn gradual escalation. See [Prompt Injection](#prompt-injection) section above.
- **Many-Shot** — Long-context exploitation. See [Prompt Injection](#prompt-injection) section above.

**Reasoning model attacks:**

- **H-CoT (Chain-of-Thought Hijacking)** — Universal attack on o1/o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking that hijacks the model's visible intermediate reasoning steps. Under H-CoT, refusal rates drop from 98% to below 2%. [arXiv:2502.12893](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12893)
- **DeepSeek-R1 Safety Assessment** — R1's baseline refusal rate is ~20% on harmful queries. Design flaw: R1 produces harmful content in its reasoning trace before its safety moderator fires. [arXiv:2502.12659](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12659)

**Multimodal attacks:**

- **Adversarial Image Jailbreaks** — Adversarial perturbations on images reliably jailbreak vision-language models (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP) even when text-based safety training is intact. Transfers across model families. [arXiv:2306.13213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13213)
- **DiffusionAttacker (multimodal)** — See above.
- **PoisonedEye** — Embeds malicious instructions inside images in RAG-indexed documents. Triggered when a vision-capable agent retrieves and processes the image. [openreview.net](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6SIymOqJlc)

**2026 jailbreak research:**

- **Mastermind (Jan 2026)** — Hierarchical planning framework that decouples high-level attack objectives from tactical execution, guided by a knowledge repository that autonomously refines effective attack patterns. Achieves 94% ASR on DeepSeek V3, 93% on GPT-4o, 90% on o3-mini, 89% on DeepSeek-R1. [arXiv:2601.05445](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05445)
- **RACE — Reasoning-Augmented Conversation (Feb 2026)** — Reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks that lead models to produce harmful content. Up to 96% overall ASR, 82% on o1, 92% on DeepSeek-R1. [arXiv:2502.11054](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.11054v2)
- **UltraBreak (Feb 2026)** — Universal adversarial patterns for vision-language models that transfer across diverse jailbreak objectives and model families. [arXiv:2602.01025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01025)
- **Reasoning Models as Autonomous Jailbreak Agents (Nature Communications 2026)** — When DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, and Qwen3 235B are used as autonomous jailbreak agents against nine target models, overall attack success rate reaches 97.14%. Converts jailbreaking from an expert activity into a non-expert-accessible automated process. [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-69010-1)

**Fine-tuning as jailbreak:**

- Standard fine-tuning on completely benign data degrades alignment. Adversarial fine-tuning with 10 examples costs <$0.20 and strips GPT-3.5's safety guardrails. [arXiv:2310.03693](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693)

**LLM-as-a-Judge exploitation:**

- Universal adversarial phrases appended to responses manipulate LLM judges into predicting inflated scores. Critical for red team pipelines that use automated evaluation. [arXiv:2402.14016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14016)
- System-prompt injection into evaluation pipelines achieves higher success rates than content-layer attacks. [arXiv:2504.18333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18333)

### Adversarial ML — Classical Models

| Attack Class | What It Does | Key Techniques |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|

### Supply Chain & Model Poisoning

**Backdoor persistence through safety training:**

- **Sleeper Agents (Anthropic, 2024)** — Backdoor behaviors survive RLHF, supervised fine-tuning, and adversarial training. A model trained to insert malicious code when the year is 2024 (but write safe code otherwise) cannot be reliably cleaned. Adversarial training may make backdoors better hidden, not smaller. [arXiv:2401.05566](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566)

**Code completion backdoors:**

- **CodeBreaker (USENIX Security 2024)** — LLM-assisted backdoor attack on code completion models that evades static analysis. Poisoned completions insert CWE-level vulnerabilities that are syntactically valid and bypass Semgrep/CodeQL. [arXiv:2406.06822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06822)

**Malicious models on Hugging Face:**

- Two PyTorch models discovered (2025) using 7z compression (not ZIP) to evade Picklescan, hiding malicious payloads in ML model files. GGUF format has no production-ready security scanner as of early 2026.
- **PickleBall (CCS 2025)** — ~44.9% of Hugging Face repos contain pickle-format models. Proposes a secure deserialization sandbox. [arXiv:2508.15987](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15987)

**Watermark attacks:**

- Watermark-removal via semantic paraphrase and watermark-spoofing (injecting a target watermark into malicious content) work against major LLM watermarking schemes. [arXiv:2402.16187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16187)
